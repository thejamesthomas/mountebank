mountebank
==========

mountebank is the first open source tool to provide cross-platform, multi-protocol test doubles over the wire.
Just point your application to mountebank instead of the real dependency,
and test like you would with traditional stubs and mocks.

At the moment, the following protocols are supported:
* http
* https
* tcp (text and binary)
* smtp
* sms

mountebank supports mock verification, stubbing with advanced predicates, JavaScript injection,
and record-playback through proxying.

See [getting started](http://www.mbtest.org/docs/gettingStarted) guide for more information.

## Goals

mountebank has the following goals:

* Trivial to get started
    * mountebank is easy to install, without any platform dependencies.  mountebank aims for fun and comprehensive documentation with lots of examples, and a nice UI that lets you explore the API interactively.
* A platform, not just a tool
    * mountebank aims to be fully cross-platform, with native language bindings.  Servers are extensible through scripting.
* Powerful
    * mountebank is the only open source stubbing tool that is non-modal and multi-protocol.  Commercial "service virtualization" solutions exist, but their licensed platforms make it hard to move the tests closer to development and can even require a specialized IDE.  mountebank provides service virtualization free of charge without any platform constraints.

Not all of mountebank's goals are currently implemented, but fear not, for he has a team of top-notch open source developers, and they are legion.
